# Info
  
When running using "mvn spring-boot:run", access "localhost:8080" and click the "Get Started" button (or scroll down, I'm not your superior).
You can then log in using any of these pre-configured accounts:

`Username    Password    Role
user1       pw1         MANAGER
user2       pw1         MANAGER
user3       pw1         PLAYER
user4       pw1         PLAYER
user5       pw1         PLAYER
user6       pw1         PLAYER
user7       pw1         PLAYER`

Any further procedures should be fairly intuitive.
